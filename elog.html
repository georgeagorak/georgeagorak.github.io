        <span class="title"> Majority Snowdon 2 'Lucky' Repair <br></span> 
      </div>
      <p>
      So this has been a weird repair.<br><br>

      I have recived this Majority Snowdon 2 soundbar from a friend of mine as he would it to be faulty.<br>
      The problem he said was that 'as if the volume down button is constently pressed'. So I got interested. <br>
      The first thing I have done was tested that the speaker was faulty at all! Which weirdly the soundbar did work... but not for long.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have found that the speak would indeed keep pressing the volume button, I checked the button but it seemed fine.
        I was considering the remote and RF sensor, I replaced the RF receiver as it was a standard ones and I had some lying around.
        That did not fixed the fault unfortunately.<br><br>
        I have started checking the manual button output.

      <p>
        I have found that the buttons result in the different voltage drop.<br>
        I have left this repair for months and meanwhile I have lost its power supply ;). So I have ordered a new one.<br><br>
        
        I have started to test it again for a prelong time to replcate the fault while I got some probes on it, however it seems that it has fixed be itself!!!!!<br><br>

        Of course, I do not believe it so my educated guess would be that the previous power supply was fault and somehow was dropping voltage on switches enough to tigger the sound down action.

          It's been more than a year now since I have completed my final year project for my BEng. <br><br>
          I would like to share here my video that I have produced for the presentation of the project to examiners <br><br>
          Please, enjoy the video and try not to cringe xD.

          As you saw... I was pretty stressed during this - well my degree dependent on it! <br><br>
          I am hoping that if I would be doing it now, I would not be stuttering as much.
          <br><br>
          See you later!

        </div>
        <p>
        I have been improving my DIY work space incrementally and continuously. <br><br> 
        Apart from general cleaning and orginising I have improved my work station with:
        <ul>
          <li>Oscilloscope (First ever self-owned!),</li>
          <li>Small monitor - got it from charity shop for Â£10 - bargain!</li>
          <li>Pegboards and LEDs lighting</li>
        </ul>

        <img class="in-text-img" src="./media/elog-media/25062023 _1_.jpg">
        
        Where the pegboards and LEDs have been installed today. furthermore, Those LED lights have been soldered and connected
        to the 12V adaptor by me :-).<br><br>

        Lastly, you may see a strange pistol like thing in the top-left corner of the pegboards.<br> This is a Bosch cordless screwdriver that I 
        have managed to aquire today for >50% discont! Very luck I was! <br><br>

        Till next time!

          <span class="title"> First 3D model! <br></span> 
        </div>
        <p>
          While working on the Sentry Gun project, I started learning 3D modelling... So I have decided to pick up FreeCAD - free & open source. <br>
          I love these 3 words. <br><br>
          So while learning it, I decided to make my own official 3D part and print it.<br>
          The part that I have 3D modelled and printed is a holder clip for XP-PEN graphic pencil!<br><br>
          It turned out great -  I posted it as my first Thingiverse Thing! <br><br>
          Go and check it out <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5944603">here</a>

          This is my first ever log!<br>
        I have completed the Websites fundamentals; all written in plain HTML,CSS and jQuery <br>
        Below, you can see an image and video. One shows the oscilloscope reading from the DCDC buck converter PWM signal...

        <p>I got plans to make a custom log entry system, so I won't have to write HTML code all the time, and I think it would be cool to make some back end and admin stuff :D.</p>
