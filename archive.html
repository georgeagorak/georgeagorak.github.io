    <p>
      Sentry Project is coming along slowly - this is because of a bit of laziness and a general lack of time; HOWEVER...<br> <br>

      I have managed to investigate the USB port charger for the water-bullet gun and update schematic with circuitry for the shooting system.

    <p>
      I could not find any datasheet for the main IC on the PCB board based on the IC's part number on the internet...  <br> <br>
      Nevertheless, I have managed to gain an understanding that this circuit is doing two things:

      <ul>
        <li>boosting the voltage from 5V to 7.4 to charge the lithium battery pack (boost converter),,</li>
        <li>and manages the battery's charge (BMS), as there is one extra wire connected to the battery pack</li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      Hello again,
      once again I was silent for a long time - I went on vacation to Bulgaria during august so not much has happend that month. <br><br>

      I have managed to come up with a better design for X-axis - it is not longer wobbly! See the video below:<br>

    </p>

    <p>
      The design is much better as now it has supports on the sides. I have used bearings as I thought they will be needed - common sense. <br><br> 
      Otherwise plastic against plastic won't be moving nicely.
      <br><br>
      Furthermore, I am once again doing the 3D modeling... I hope I will be done soon as I am quite tired of 3D modelling now.
      <br> Plan is that I have to only now make the cover for the top and place holder for the bullets. Then I will be concentraing on Hardware and Software integration.
      <br> Small peak at the work I am doing now:

      To sum up things, I have progress Sentry project to the point where I can some coding... to find 
      max,min and other values. <br><br>
      Here are some materials that you may find intresting: <br>

      <span class="title"> Sentry #4: Gears and their setback.. <br></span> 
    </div>
    <p>
        As I have realised that the design i had in mind would absolutly tangle the wires even with using the slip ring..<br>
        I have lost hope.... <br><br>

        However, I have came up with an idea to use gears! This will allow for no wire tangling and the 120 degree servo can be use! <br>
        As iwth the right Gear Ration, servo can be transformed into 360 mmovement at the cost of a resolution.
        <br><br>
        No much progress as I have to learn about gears, design them and model them... 
        <br><br>
        
        Till next time!

    <p>Right, so ... Its clear I am not consistent. <br>
       I have been doing quite a lot lately about the project; mainly 3D modelling, planning and ordering missing/extra parts. <br><br>

       I have managed to 3D model legs, battery container and motherboard.

    <p>
      Well its been a while... went for vacation to Cornwall wish was in May and I have been concentraing on my full-time job and trianing... <br><br>

      What little I did to the project:
      <ul>
        <li>Due to my laziness and the deadline for comicon, I will reduce the functionality (expectations) of the Sentry Project - it can always be better!</li>
        <li>Bought more tools and components for the project e.g. bolts and nuts, crimp tool with crimps, soldering PCB and connector etc.</li>
        <li>have done initial testing of the servo motors and relay modules - It looked fine!</li>
        <li>Decided on the battey - it is a lead acid battery 12V 4.5ah - Yes it will be heavier but its less complicated to manage.</li>
        <li>Waiting for the Slip ring for the cables to arrive... should come soon from far East...</li>
        <li>Switch to modeling in SketchUp - its just much simpler adn quicker learn. <br> I have made my own component library so they can be reused</li>


      </ul>

    <p>
      I will try to be more frequent with updates and just be less lazy!!!
      .... Although I'm going to watch Spidervers tomorrow :D
