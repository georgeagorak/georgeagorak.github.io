          It's been more than a year now since I have completed my final year project for my BEng. <br><br>
          I would like to share here my video that I have produced for the presentation of the project to examiners <br><br>
          Please, enjoy the video and try not to cringe xD. 
        </p>

          As you saw... I was pretty stressed during this - well my degree dependent on it! <br><br>
          I am hoping that if I would be doing it now, I would not be stuttering as much.
          <br><br>
          See you later!

        </div>
        <p>
        I have been improving my DIY work space incrementally and continuously. <br><br> 
        Apart from general cleaning and orginising I have improved my work station with:
        <ul>
          <li>Oscilloscope (First ever self-owned!),</li>
          <li>Small monitor - got it from charity shop for Â£10 - bargain!</li>
          <li>Pegboards and LEDs lighting</li>
        </ul>

        <img class="in-text-img" src="./media/elog-media/25062023 _1_.jpg">
        
        Where the pegboards and LEDs have been installed today. furthermore, Those LED lights have been soldered and connected
        to the 12V adaptor by me :-).<br><br>

        Lastly, you may see a strange pistol like thing in the top-left corner of the pegboards.<br> This is a Bosch cordless screwdriver that I 
        have managed to aquire today for >50% discont! Very luck I was! <br><br>

        Till next time!

          <span class="title"> First 3D model! <br></span> 
        </div>
        <p>
          While working on the Sentry Gun project, I started learning 3D modelling... So I have decided to pick up FreeCAD - free & open source. <br>
          I love these 3 words. <br><br>
          So while learning it, I decided to make my own official 3D part and print it.<br>
          The part that I have 3D modelled and printed is a holder clip for XP-PEN graphic pencil!<br><br>
          It turned out great -  I posted it as my first Thingiverse Thing! <br><br>
          Go and check it out <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5944603">here</a>

        <p>
          This is my first ever log!<br>
        I have completed the Websites fundamentals; all written in plain HTML,CSS and jQuery <br>
        Below, you can see an image and video. One shows the oscilloscope reading from the DCDC buck converter PWM signal...

        <p>... and the other is the early beginning of one of my university group projects</p>
        <iframe class="in-text-vid" src="https://youtube.com/embed/tvmqXXDi1sg"></iframe>
        <p>I got plans to make a custom log entry system, so I won't have to write HTML code all the time, and I think it would be cool to make some back end and admin stuff :D.</p>
